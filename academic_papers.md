## Paper summaries

These are notes/summaries I have made of various journal articles or scientific papers over the course of my research. My typical workflow is to make handwritten notes, then at a later date, rewrite the notes in markdown to refresh my knowledge. That being said, in some cases I have uploaded scans of the handwritten notes instead.

For each article, I have hyperlinked the title of the article to the pdf/markdown version of my notes. Within each topic, they are arranged by author. If you are looking for a specific article, I suggest you cmd/ctrl-f, as there are a decent number of them.
