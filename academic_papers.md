## Paper summaries

*These are notes/summaries I have made of various journal articles or scientific papers over the course of my research (some handwritten, some in markdown). In each case, I have hyperlinked the title of the article to the pdf of my notes. Within each topic, they are arranged by author. If you are looking for a specific article, I suggest you cmd/ctrl-f, as there are a fair number of articles*
