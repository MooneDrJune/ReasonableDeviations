# IB Maths

Within the Natural Sciences Tripos at Cambridge, in first and second year there is a dedicated mathematics subject (which was my favourite subject in both years).

The Cambridge course is very much a Mathematical Methods course, focussing on creative application rather than formality.

Unlike for physics, I haven't followed the structure of the official course handout in these notes. Instead, I have chosen to group together certain topics (for example, Sturm-Liouville theory with the other ODE stuff).

- [Vector calculus]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1B_vectorcalc.pdf)
- [Linear algebra]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1B_linalg.pdf)
  - Vector spaces
  - Matrices
  - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
  - Cartesia tensors
- [Ordinary differential equations]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1B_ode.pdf)
  - 2nd order ODEs
  - Impulses and Green's functions 
  - Series solutions to ODEs
  - Sturm-Liouville Theory
- [Partial differential equations ]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1B_pde.pdf) 
  - Laplace's and Poisson's equations
  - Method of images
- [Calculus of Variations]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1B_calc_variations.pdf)
- [Fourier theory]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1B_fourier.pdf)
  - Fourier series
  - Fourier transforms and convolutions
  - Complex methods 
- [Analysis]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1B_analysis.pdf)
  - Power series and singularities
  - Complex analysis and contour integration
