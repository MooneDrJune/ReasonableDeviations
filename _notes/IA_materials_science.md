# IA Materials Science

These are my notes for Cambridge's IA Materials Science course (first-year). They are basically a hand-written and condensed version of the course notes, with some minor additions. They were written on yellow paper, which unfortunately hasn't scanned very well.


- [Course A: Atomic Structure of Materials]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1A_crsA.pdf)
- [Course B: Materials for Devices]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1A_crsB.pdf)
- [Course C: Diffraction]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1A_crsC.pdf)
- [Course D: Microstructure]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1A_crsD.pdf)
- [Course E: Mechanical Behaviour of Materials]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1A_crsE.pdf)
- [Course F: Biomaterials]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1A_crsF.pdf)
- [Course G: Materials under Extreme Conditions]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1A_crsG.pdf)
