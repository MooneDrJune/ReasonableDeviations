# II Astrophysics

In Part II (3rd year undergraduate), I chose to study Astrophysics rather than Physics. Cambridge Astrophysics consists of 8 compulsory lecture courses and the CATAM (computational coursework shared with maths students).

For all of the courses except Cosmology and Topics in Astrophysics, I made handwritten notes based on the lectures. Closer to the exams, I typed up the notes into RemNote, which automatically generates spaced-repetition flashcards. 

The RemNote documents (which can be viewed as flashcards by clicking "Test yourself on these rem") are linked [here](https://www.remnote.io/a/astrophysics/60d47dec918e46003460e75f).
