# IB HL Chemistry

Here are the notes, separated by topic:

1.  [Quantitative Chemistry](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/quantitative-chemistry.pdf "Quantitative Chemistry")
2.  [Periodicity](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/periodicity.pdf "Periodicity")
3.  [Atomic Structure](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/atomic-structure.pdf "Atomic Structure")
4.  [Bonding](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/bonding.pdf "Bonding")
5.  [Energetics](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/energetics.pdf "Energetics")
6.  [Kinetics and Equilibrium](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/kinetics-and-equilibrium.pdf "Kinetics and Equilibrium")
7.  [Acids and Bases](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/acids-and-bases.pdf "Acids and Bases") (+ additional [howto for calculations ](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/acid-base-calculations.pdf))
8.  [Oxidation and Reduction](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/oxidation-and-reduction.pdf "Oxidation and Reduction")
9.  [Organic Chemistry](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/organic-chemistry.pdf "Organic Chemistry")

- Option1: [Drugs and medicine ](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/acid-base-calculations.pdf "Acid base calculations")
- Option2: [Modern Analytical](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/modern-analytical.pdf "Modern Analytical")

Or, a [zip file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8zIkl4xIcCiMGQwTzhSWURTeDQ) containing everything. I have also made a TIL (Today I Learnt) document, listing things that I learnt while doing past papers. I suggest you peruse these, as most of them are quite subtle points that simply need to be known: [Chemistry TIL](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/chemistry-til.pdf "Chemistry TIL").


# About the notes

As you may see, these chemistry notes are not all in the same format. Some are typed, some are done on paper (and even those aren't homogeneous). This is because as we learnt the topics in class, I made notes before each test. It was my intention to redo these and make a nice complete set of good notes prior to the final exams. However, in the end I realised that this would be rather inefficient. The best notes -- the new ones I made -- are probably the ones on Kinetics, Equilibrium and Chemistry in Industry (the typed notes aren't too shabby either). Bear in mind that these are for the 2015 exams, so please refer to your new syllabus accordingly. I have also included an 'Acid Base Calculations' sheet, which I put together to remind me how to do the calculations.

*   I believe that one of our options, Modern Analytical Chemistry, has now been assimilated into your core. So perhaps you may find some of that useful (I never did, since I gave up and studied another option a few weeks before the final).
*   In Organic Chemistry, I didn't write the proper Sn2 mechanism the first time, the correct one is under heading 20.2.
