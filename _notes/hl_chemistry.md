# IB HL Chemistry

Here are the notes, separated by topic:

1.  [Quantitative Chemistry](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/quantitative-chemistry.pdf "Quantitative Chemistry")
2.  [Periodicity](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/periodicity.pdf "Periodicity")
3.  [Atomic Structure](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/atomic-structure.pdf "Atomic Structure")
4.  [Bonding](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/bonding.pdf "Bonding")
5.  [Energetics](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/energetics.pdf "Energetics")
6.  [Kinetics and Equilibrium](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/kinetics-and-equilibrium.pdf "Kinetics and Equilibrium")
7.  [Acids and Bases](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/acids-and-bases.pdf "Acids and Bases") (+ additional [howto for calculations ](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/acid-base-calculations.pdf))
8.  [Oxidation and Reduction](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/oxidation-and-reduction.pdf "Oxidation and Reduction")
9.  [Organic Chemistry](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/organic-chemistry.pdf "Organic Chemistry")

- Option1: [Drugs and medicine ](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/acid-base-calculations.pdf "Acid base calculations")
- Option2: [Modern Analytical](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/modern-analytical.pdf "Modern Analytical")

Or, a [zip file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8zIkl4xIcCiMGQwTzhSWURTeDQ) containing everything. I have also made a TIL (Today I Learnt) document, listing things that I learnt while doing past papers. I suggest you peruse these, as most of them are quite subtle points that simply need to be known: [Chemistry TIL](https://reasonabledeviations.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/chemistry-til.pdf "Chemistry TIL").


# About the notes

As you may see, these chemistry notes are not all in the same format. Some are typed, some are done on paper (and even those aren't homogeneous). This is because as we learnt the topics in class, I made notes before each test. It was my intention to redo these and make a nice complete set of good notes prior to the final exams. However, I couldn't be bothered because I didn't really enjoy chemistry as much as I did physics. The best notes, the new ones I made, are probably the Kinetics-Equilibirum ones (as well as the typed ones). Bear in mind that these are for the 2015 exams, and the syllabus is different, so these may not directly correspond to what you're learning, though there are many similarities. I have also included an 'Acid Base Calculations' sheet, which I put together to remind me how to do the calculations - Acid Base calculations are the toughest in all of HL Chem. That being said, they have removed some of the hard calculations (buffer solutions) from your core, so you will only encounter those if you do the right option. Miscellaneous

*   I believe that one of our options, Modern Analytical Chemistry, has now been assimilated into your core. So perhaps you may find some of that useful (I never did, since I gave up and studied another option a few weeks before the final).
*   In Organic Chemistry, I didn't write the proper Sn2 mechanism the first time, the correct one is under heading 20.2.


# How to do Chemistry

I'm only putting this here because I have done the same for maths and physics. Honestly, I'm not qualified to tell you how to do chemistry. Although I was good at chemistry (I considered it to be my easiest IB subject), I just found that there weren't any difficult concepts, and they didn't ask any challenging questions. It was just a matter of memorising a lot of facts and explanations (I don't mean this with any negative connotations). As such, to do well at chemistry, you need two things. Notes, and past papers. Have fun!
