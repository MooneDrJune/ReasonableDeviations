## Complexity 

$$f(n) \in O(g(n)) \Longleftrightarrow \exists N, c_1, c_2 >0 \text{ s.t. } \forall n > N: 0 \leq g(n) \leq k g(n) $$

More informally, we can define other asymptotic nation as follows:

</center>

In the analysis of algorithms, many assumptions about hardware and basic operations must be made, e.g array access is constant time. 

## Sorting Algorithms

- Sorting is important because we can search sorted arrays very efficiently, in $O(\log n)$ time.
- In the worst case, $\Theta(n)$ exchanges will be needed. 
- Comparison-based algorithms require at least $\Omega(n\lg n)$ comparisons.

### Insertion Sort

Maintain a sorted section of the array, then insert new items into the correct position.

```python
def insertion_sort(a):
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        # assert first i positions sorted
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and a[j] > a[j+1]:
            swap(j, j+1)
            j -= 1  
```

- Inserting the last element needs at most $n-1$ comparisons and swaps. The second last element requires $n-2$...

$$T(n) = 2 (1 + 2 + \cdots + n - 1) = n(n-1)$$

- So insertion sort is $O(n^2)$. That said, it has a very small constant term so is often faster than $O(n \lg n)$ algorithms for small *n*. 
- It is stable as long as we only swap if the element is larger than the key.

### Selection sort 

At each iteration, find the minimum of the remaining array and swap it to the current index. 

```python
def selection_sort(a):
    for i in range(len(a)):
        swap(i, argmin(a[i:end]))
```

$O(n^2)$ and unstable. Its only advantage is that it is easy to analyse.

### Binary insertion sort

Same as insertion sort, except we find the correct position using binary partitioning.

```python
def binary_insertion_sort(a):
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        hi = i
        lo = 0
        while lo < hi:
            j = (hi + lo) // 2
            if a[i] > a[j]:
                lo = j + 1
            else:
                hi = j
        
        # Swap a[i] into the right place
        tmp = a[i]
        for j from i - 1 down to (hi - 1):
            a[j+1] = a[j]
        a[hi] = tmp
```

Binary insertion sort will be preferred to insertion sort when comparisons are expensive, but the swapping costs mean that it is still $O(n^2)$.

### Bubblesort

In each pass, go through the list swapping adjacent elements as needed. If no swaps are done in a pass, the array is sorted. 

```python
def bubblesort(a):
    while True:
        didSwap = False
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] > a[i+1]:
                swap(i, i+1)
                didSwap = True
        if not didSwap:
            break
```

- In the worst case, an element will be *n* positions away from its final position, so the complexity is $O(n^2)$.
- Stable

### Mergesort

Divide and conquer algorithm that splits the list in two then recursively sorts each half, before merging sorted lists.

```python
def mergesort(a, lo, hi):
    if lo < hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2
        mergesort(a, lo, mid)
        mergesort(a, mid+1, hi)
        merge(a, lo, mid, hi)
        
def merge(a, lo, mid, hi):
    # both these subarrays are sorted
    l = a[lo: mid]
    r = a[mid+1 : hi]
    
    aux = [] * (len(l) + len(r))
    
    i = lo
    j = mid + 1
    
    for k in range(len(aux)):
        if i > mid: # fill using right only 
            aux[k] = aux[j]
            j += 1
        else if j > hi: # fill using left only
            aux[k] = a[i]
            i += 1
        else if a[i] <= a[j]: # otherwise compare
            aux[k] = a[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            aux[k] = a[j]
            j++
```

- $\Theta (n \lg n)$ runtime, but requires $O(n)$ extra space.
- Mergesort is stable because there is no reordering of equal elements.
- Mergesort can instead be implemented bottom-up, merging pairs, then pairs of pairs, then pairs of fours, etc.

```python
def mergesort(a):
    step = 1
    while (step < len(a)):
        for lo in range(0, len(a), 2*step):
            mid = lo + step - 1;
            hi = min(lo + 2*step - 1, len(a) - 1);
            merge(aux, lo, mid, hi);    
```

### Quicksort

Choose the last item as the pivot, then partition the array into items â‰¤ the pivot and items > pivot. Put the pivot in the middle then recursively sort left and right.

```python
def quicksort(a):
    pivot = a[len(a) - 1]
    i = 0
    j = len(a) - 2
    
    while i <= j:
        if a[i] > pivot and a[j] <= pivot:
            swap(i, j)
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else if a[i] <= pivot:
            i += 1
        else: j -= 1
        
    # ASSERT i == j + 1
    # ASSERT all items to the left of i <= pivot
    swap(j, len(a) - 1)
    quicksort(a[0:j])
    quicksort(a[j+1:end])
```

- $O(n \lg n)$ average case, $O(n^2)$ worst case.
- Requires $O(\lg n)$ additional space to store stack frames, but $O(n)$ in the worst case.
- Unstable.

### Order statistics 

A quicksort-like algorithm can be used to compute the median and, more generally, **order statistics**.

1. Select a pivot and partition the array into subarrays of size $p$ and $n-p$
2. If $k < p$, recursively look for the kth item in the lower partition. 
3. Otherwise recurse into the upper partition to find rank $k-p$

This has recurrence:

$$T(n) = f(n/2) + kn = O(n)$$

However, the worst case is $O(n^2)$ as with quicksort. There exists a guaranteed linear time algorithm but it is much more complicated.

### Heapsort


### Counting sort 

Counting sort does not require comparisons. Assuming that the inputs are positive integers within some range, it counts the number of each element, then finds the cumulative sum, from which we can identify exactly where a given element should go.

```python
def counting_sort(a):
    count = [0] * max(a)
    for x in a:
        count[x] += 1
    # cumulate
    for i in range(1, len(count)):
        count[i] += count[i-1]
    
    sorted = [0] * len(a)
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, 0 included):
        idx = count[a[i]] - 1
        sorted[idx] = a[i]
        count[a[i]] -= 1
    return sorted
```

- It is a stable sorting algorithm, with $\Theta(n)$ cost.

### Bucketsort

Bucketsort creates an array of buckets (linked lists), with the assumption that elements will fall into these buckets uniformly. We can then run insertion sort within each bucket before concatenating the buckets into a sorted array. 

```python
def bucket_sort(a):
    # assuming that elements are drawn uniformly from [0,1]
    n = len(a)
    bucketWidth = 1/n
    buckets = new [] of length n
    
    for x in a:
        idx = int(x / bucketWidth)
        bucket[idx].next = x
    
    sorted = []
    for b in buckets:
        insertion_sort(b)
        sorted.append(b)
    return b
```

We use insertion sort because each bucket should contain only one element on average. But the worst case is still $O(n^2)$ as a result.

### Radix sort


## Dynamic programming 

Dynamic programming tends to be useful when problems have the following features:

1. There exist many choices each with some 'score'
2. The optimal solution is composed of optimal solutions to subproblems
3. The subproblems overlap.

### Matrix multiplication

### Longest common substring

### Rod cutting

## Greedy algorithms 



## Graph algorithms 

### DFS

Used to traverse or search a graph. 

```python
def dfs(g, s):
    for v in g.vertices:
        v.visited = False
    stack = Stack()
    stack.push(s)
    s.visited = True
    
    while not stack.empty():
        v = stack.pop()
        for w in v.neighbours:
            if not w.seen:
                stack.push(w)
            w.visited = True
```
- $O(V+E)$ runtime

### BFS

Used to traverse or search a graph. 

```python
def bfs(g, s):
    for v in g.vertices:
        v.visited = False
    s.visited = True

    q = new Queue()
    q.push(s)
    
    while not q.empty():
        v = q.pop()
        for w in v.neighbours():
            if not w.visited:
                q.push(w)
            w.visited = True
```

- To use DFS or BFS to find a path, we just have to update a `previous` field for each node, then walk back from the target to the start.
- $O(V+E)$ runtime

### Dijkstra

- After running Dijkstra, the `distance` field contains the minimum distance from `s` to that vertex. 
- Similar to BFS, except we use a priority queue to store vertices. If we visit a vertex that has already been seen, we update its distance and its position in the priority queue. 

```python
def dijkstra(g, s):
    for v in g.vertices:
        v.distance = infinity
    s.distance = 0
    
    pq = PriorityQueue(sortkey = lambda v: v.distance)
    pq.push(s)
    
    while not pq.empty():
        v = pq.popmin()
        for (w, edgecost) in v.neighbours:
            dist = v.distance + edgecost
            if dist < w.distance:
                w.distance = dist
                
                if w in pq:
                    pq.decreasekey(w)
                else: 
                    pq.push(w) 
```

- $O(E + V \log V)$ runtime

### Bellman-Ford

Used to find the minweight path (i.e same as Dijkstra but works for negative weights)

Relax all the edges in a graph, for V-1 passes. If there are any changes in the last round, there is a negative weight cycle.

```python
def bellman_ford(g, s):
    
    for v in g.vertices:
        v.minweight = infinity
    s.minweight = 0
    
    # relax all edge
    for _ in range(len(g.vertices) - 1):
        for (u, v, c) in v.edges:
            if v.minweight > (u.minweight + c):
                v.minweight = u.minweight + c

    # check for negative cycles in last pass
    for (u, v, c) in v.edges:
        if v.minweight > u.minweight + c:
            raise NegativeWeightCycle()
```

### Prim

- Greedy algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree by choosing the lowest weight connector to a new vertex
- Very similar to Dijkstra, except:
    - need to keep track of the tree
    - update distance from tree instead of distance from start
- Returns the list of edges in the MST.

```python
def prim(g, s):
    for v in g.vertices:
        v.distance = infinity
        v.in_tree = False
        
    s.come_from = None
    s.distance = 0
    s.in_tree = True
    
    pq = new PriorityQueue(sortkey = lambda v: v.distance)
    
    while not pq.empty():
        v = pq.popmin()
        v.in_tree = True 
        
        for (w, edgeweight) in v.neighbours:
            if edgeweight < w.distance and (not w.in_tree):
                w.distance = edgeweight
                w.come_from = v
                if w in pq:
                    pq.decreasekey()
                else:
                    pq.push(w)
    
    return [(w, w.come_from) for w in g.vertices excluding s]
```

Runtime the same as Dijkstra, i.e $O(E + V \log V)$.

### Kruskal

- Builds a minimum spanning tree by greedily merging subtrees, starting with *V* trees of order 0.

```python
def kruskal(g):
    tree_edges = []
    
    partition = DisjointSet() 
    
    for v in g.vertices:
        partition.add_singleton(v)
        
    edges = sorted(g.edges, sortkey = lambda u, v, edgeweight: edgeweight)
    
    for (u, v, edgeweight) in edges:
        p = partition.get_set_with(u)
        q = partition.get_set_with(v)
        
        if p != q:
            tree_edges.append((u, v))
            parition.merge(p, q)
            
    return tree_edges
```

Runtime is dominated by the sort: $O(E log E) = O(E log V)$.


### Topological sort 

- Recursive DFS (for all nodes), prepend to list once `visit(v)` returns.

```python
def topological_sort(g):
    for v in g.vertices:
        v.visited = False
        # v.colour = "white"
    
    totalorder = []

    for v in g.vertices:
        if not v.visited: 
            visit(v, totalorder)

    return totalorder
            
def visit(v, totalorder):
    v.visited = True
    # v.colour = "grey"
    for w in v.neighbours:
        if not w.visited:
            visit(w, totalorder)
    totalorder.prepend(v)
    # v.colour = "black"
```

Same runtime as DFS: $O(V+E)$
