# IB Physics 

In Part IB (second year), there are two physics subjects. Physics A covers "modern" physics, while Physics B focuses on the classical topics. The typical physical natural sciences student will do both physics subjects along with IB Mathematics. 

Each subject consists of a few different lecture courses, which span most of the academic year. I have provided a breakdown of the subtopics within each course.

## Physics A

- [Experimental methods]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1B_experimental.pdf)

  - Errors
  - Sampling
  - Inference
- [Oscillations and waves]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1B_owo.pdf)
  - Waves
  - Fourier series
  - Diffraction
  - Optics
  - Interference
- [Quantum mechanics]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1B_quantum.pdf)
  - Wavefunctions and the Schrodinger equation
  - Bound particles
  - Operator algebra
  - Time-dependent QM
  - QM in 3D
  - Spin
  - Matrix mechanics
  - Multiparticle systems
- Condensed matter (omitted)

## Physics B

- [Electromagnetism]({{ site.imageurl }}../notes/1B_electrodynamics.pdf)
  - Electrostatics
  - Dielectrics
  - Magnetostatics
  - Magnetic fields in matters
  - EM introduction
