My name is Robert. I recently graduated from the University of Cambridge where I studied Natural Sciences, ultimately specialising in Astrophysics.

I am interested in finding intuitive quantitative explanations for complex phenomena, even if those intuitive explanations concede a lack of determinism. It is always nice to find order in complexity, but I think we should accept that it may very well be complex all the way down. I'm a logical person who holds rationality dear, though I'm equally interested in the limits of rationality and the need to make decisions under epistemic uncertainty, accounting for "model risk".

There was a time when I wanted to be a physicist, but "messy" systems like financial markets attract my attention nowadays. You can't understand these systems on a blackboard; you have to get your hands dirty and dive into the data. Programming is a key weapon in this endeavour.

## Programming

Whenever I need a computer to help me, I first turn to python. I've been using python (primarily for scientific purposes) for about {{ 'now' | date: "%Y" | minus: 2014  }} years, and its initial charm has never really faded. With its pseudocode-like syntax and clear philosophy (type `import this` into a python console), it lets you get your ideas into a computer with relative ease. Of course you aren't going to get C-like speeds natively, but nowadays there are options like cython or Numba which can alleviate this to a certain extent.

I concede that R has a better statistics ecosystem – there is an R implementation for basically any useful theorem/procedure in statistics. I've used it for a number of data science projects and I appreciate its intuitive data processing. But I think that its lead over python will narrow over time as more and more people re-implement R packages in python.

I didn't learn Java by choice – it is the language that Cambridge teaches first-year computer scientists. It's a fantastic language to frame discussions of OOP and design patterns, but writing Java just doesn't spark joy for me. That being said, for things like mission-critical enterprise codebases, Java's verbosity and 'safety' blow python out of the water.

Julia is a language that I've become obsessed with recently. The headline pitch is that it offers python-like syntax with C-like speeds. But there are many other reasons why Julia is a joy to code in: a *wonderful* packaging system (blows `pip` out of the water), really cool metaprogramming functionality that allows for neat implementations of autograd etc, excellent integrations with other languages via e.g PyCall or RCall.

## Finance

Financial markets are interesting to me philosophically because they encode the beliefs of many different agents into tradable quantities. Practically, I haven't been able to find an area that has the same mix of programming, world affairs, mathematics, psychology. If we define rationality as the goal of maintaining an accurate set of beliefs about the world and updating these beliefs in accordance with Bayes theorem, then trading on financial markets is a pure expression of rationality -- "betting" on outcomes penalises miscalibration.

I've previously worn both discretionary and systematic hats; I'm currently most intrigued by two specific areas areas:

- "Quantitative discretionary": strategies that incorporate a rigorous scientific approach into human decisionmaking. 
- Hypothesis-driven systematic: I love the idea of systematising edge, though I am much more interested in building hypotheses about the world rather than black-box optimisations.

## Crypto

I became fascinated by the crypto space in 2016 -- it has been delightful to watch it morph and grow over the past few years. I spent some time as a blockchain consultant, focussing on the strategic aspects of blockchain for several South-East Asian companies, including an exchange. While in university, I worked on a blockchain startup with some friends (which you can read about [here]({% post_url 2019-09-01-what-we-learnt-enterprise-blockchain %})).

As of late my interest has narrowed into crypto markets (as opposed to blockchain technology). I'm fascinated by the opportunities that arise in a liquid but not-entirely-efficient market, for example the crypto [basis trade](https://binancepremiums.com/), as well as various aspects of DeFi.

## Books

Reading is such an important part of my life. I try not to limit my reading to specific subjects -- it's can be incredibly valuable to continuously attempt to read about subjects that are new to you, such that you "know what you don't know". This also applies to a lesser degree with fiction, though I now don't bother trying to rationalise reading fiction and happily concede that "I just enjoy it".

Check out this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/robertmartin88/status/1442145883047399437) for an explanation of my reading workflow. 

Below are some of my favourite books (or short stories); I suppose there is an overrepresentation of science fiction, but I can't apologise for being fascinated by it!

## Timeline

- **Sep 2020 - Present** Interning at BlueCrest Capital Management (trading)
- **July 2020**: Interning at the D.E. Shaw Group (prop trading)
- **June 2020**: Graduated from Cambridge with a first class degree in Astrophysics. It was a strange three years and I still don't think I've had time to properly reflect.
- **April 2020**: Back to Cambridge one last time! It's hard to find a balance between socialising and exam revision.
- **December 2020**: COVID-19 round 2 -- I am studying remotely from Singapore. Sadly it won't be like last year where exams are cancelled, so I don't have as much time as I'd like to pursue side projects.
- **October 2020**: Started 3rd year at Cambridge. I swapped from physics to astrophysics, looking for something slightly more computational. 
- **June 2020**: Interning at Point72 Asset Management, doing long/short equity investment. It's tough working remotely, but the learning rate is insanely high.
- **March 2020**: pandemic times! Easter term at Cambridge is "cancelled" (i.e informal exams only). On the bright side, I've got plenty of time to work on my own projects and have been fairly active in blogging.
- **October 2019**: Started my second year at Cambridge, where I'm studying physics and maths. I'm involved with several societies, including: college tennis, Hackbridge (a tech entrepreneurship society), CUFIS (the finance soc). 
- **September 2019**: Interning at the London office of a team within GIC, Singapore's Soveign Wealth Fund, where I get to build cool things at the intersection of finance and tech.
- **July 2019**: Interning at a long-only fund called Albizia. Learning about discretionary investments, meeting company executives, building an alternative data analytics app in Ruby on Rails.
- **June 2019**: Just finished my first year at Cambridge. What an absolute whirlwind! Lots of ups and downs, but managed to pull through and get a first. 
- **October 2018**: Started studying Natural Sciences at Cambridge. I spent the previous months trying to learn as much as I could about finance and statistics in the meanwhile, because I knew that I'd probably be mostly occupied with physics and maths at uni.
- **June 2018**: Splitting my time between a quantitative finance internship and blockchain consulting.
- **May 2018**: Finished national service! ORD loh
- **January 2017**: Passed out from the Medical Response Force conversion course, which was 8 weeks of very tough training. Military driving (March 2017), Sergeant school (Dec 2017), MRF section leader and Instructor (Jan 2018).
- **December 2017**: Finished combat medic training and started the Medical Response Force conversion course. MRF is a unit of specially trained combat medics who deal with chemical, biological and radiological threats. It is part of the Special Operations Taskforce, so we are expected to be operationally ready at all times.
- **September 2017**: Finished basic training and started combat medic training.
- **July 2016**: Enlisted into the army. In Singapore, there are two years of compulsory national service (NS) for citizens or permanent residents (that's me).
- **January 2016**: Accepted to study Physical Natural Sciences at Christ's College Cambridge, with two years deferred entry (October 2018 matriculation)
- **November 2015**: Graduated from high school, having completed my International Baccalaureate, I studied higher-level maths, chemistry, and physics, with an extended essay in maths, and scored 45 points overall.
