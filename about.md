My name is Robert. I am a soon-to-be undergraduate natural sciences student at the University of Cambridge.

I like to try to find intuitive quantitative explanations for complex phenomena, even if those intuitive explanations concede a lack of determinism. It is always nice to find order in chaos, but it may very well be chaos all the way down.

I'm a logical person who holds rationalism dear. Physics and mathematics are my fortes, but I have been expanding that to computer science and finance.

Whenever I need a computer to help me, I first turn to python. However, for more statistics-oriented programs, I use R. I am going to start learning Java, partially that's what Cambridge will teach in their first year for computer science, and partially because pain builds character.

Finance is inherently interesting to me, because it represents a quantification of the beliefs and wills of so many individuals (point particles if you like) â€“ and in my mind, quantification is the first step to prediction and/or understanding.


On top of the very general 'physics and maths', here are some specific interests (in no particular order):
- machine learning on fundamental stock data
- nice tricks to do integrals
- backtesting various technical analysis strategies to separate the fairy tales from the profit.
- 'pure' statistics (e.g probability generating functions)
- blockchain-based smart contracts, espcecially Ethereum

One day I wish to be able to use my knowledge in physics and mathematical methods to be able to find order in financial markets, or failing that, to quantify and control the chaos.


## Timeline

I graduated from high school in November 2015, having completed my International Baccalaureate.

In July 2016, I enlisted into the army; in Singapore, there are two years of compulsory national service (NS) for citizens or permanent residents (that's me).

At the start of 2016, I was accepted to study the Physical Natural Sciences at Cambridge, with two years deferred entry.

In October 2018, I will enter university. In the mean while, I'm trying to make the most of my time in NS.

I plan to choose physics, chemistry, computer science, and advanced maths for my first year, thereafter dropping computer science and chemistry.
